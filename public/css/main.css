 * Creates a rule that will be applied when an MDC-Web component is within the context of an RTL layout.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   position: absolute;
 *   left: 0;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     left: auto;
 *     right: 0;
 *   }

 *   &__bar {

 *       margin-right: 4px;
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * .mdc-foo--mod {

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     padding-left: auto;
 *     padding-right: 4px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

 *
 * ```html

/**
 * Takes a base box-model property - e.g. margin / border / padding - along with a default
 * direction and value, and emits rules which apply the value to the
 * "<base-property>-<default-direction>" property by default, but flips the direction
 * when within an RTL context.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, left, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   margin-left: 8px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 8px;
 *     margin-left: 0;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * whereas:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, right, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 0;
 *     margin-left: 8px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also pass a 4th optional $root-selector argument which will be forwarded to `mdc-rtl`,
 * e.g. `@include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box-property(margin, left, 8px, ".mdc-component")`.
 *
 * Note that this function will always zero out the original value in an RTL context. If you're
 * trying to flip the values, use mdc-rtl-reflexive-property().

/**
 * Creates a rule that will be applied when an MDC-Web component is within the context of an RTL layout.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   position: absolute;
 *   left: 0;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     left: auto;
 *     right: 0;
 *   }
 *
 *   &__bar {
 *     margin-left: 4px;
 *     @include mdc-rtl(".mdc-foo") {
 *       margin-left: auto;
 *       margin-right: 4px;
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * .mdc-foo--mod {
 *   padding-left: 4px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     padding-left: auto;
 *     padding-right: 4px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that this works by checking for [dir="rtl"] on an ancestor element. While this will work
 * in most cases, it will in some cases lead to false negatives, e.g.
 *
 * ```html
 * <html dir="rtl">
 *   <!-- ... -->
 *   <div dir="ltr">
 *     <div class="mdc-foo">Styled incorrectly as RTL!</div>
 *   </div>
 * </html>
 * ```
 *
 * In the future, selectors such as :dir (http://mdn.io/:dir) will help us mitigate this.
 */
/**
 * Takes a base box-model property - e.g. margin / border / padding - along with a default
 * direction and value, and emits rules which apply the value to the
 * "<base-property>-<default-direction>" property by default, but flips the direction
 * when within an RTL context.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, left, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   margin-left: 8px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 8px;
 *     margin-left: 0;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * whereas:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, right, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   margin-right: 8px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 0;
 *     margin-left: 8px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also pass a 4th optional $root-selector argument which will be forwarded to `mdc-rtl`,
 * e.g. `@include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box-property(margin, left, 8px, ".mdc-component")`.
 *
 * Note that this function will always zero out the original value in an RTL context. If you're
 * trying to flip the values, use mdc-rtl-reflexive-property().
 */
/**
 * Takes a base property and emits rules that assign <base-property>-left to <left-value> and

 * .mdc-foo {

/**
 * Creates a rule that will be applied when an MDC-Web component is within the context of an RTL layout.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   position: absolute;
 *   left: 0;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     left: auto;
 *     right: 0;
 *   }
 *
 *   &__bar {
 *     margin-left: 4px;
 *     @include mdc-rtl(".mdc-foo") {
 *       margin-left: auto;
 *       margin-right: 4px;
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * .mdc-foo--mod {

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     padding-left: auto;
 *     padding-right: 4px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that this works by checking for [dir="rtl"] on an ancestor element. While this will work
 * in most cases, it will in some cases lead to false negatives, e.g.
 *
 * ```html
 * <html dir="rtl">
 *   <!-- ... -->
 *   <div dir="ltr">
 *     <div class="mdc-foo">Styled incorrectly as RTL!</div>
 *   </div>
 * </html>

 *
 * In the future, selectors such as :dir (http://mdn.io/:dir) will help us mitigate this.

 * direction and value, and emits rules which apply the value to the
 * "<base-property>-<default-direction>" property by default, but flips the direction

 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, left, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss

 *     margin-left: 0;

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 0;
 *     margin-left: 8px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also pass a 4th optional $root-selector argument which will be forwarded to `mdc-rtl`,
 * e.g. `@include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box-property(margin, left, 8px, ".mdc-component")`.
 *
 * Note that this function will always zero out the original value in an RTL context. If you're

/**
 * Creates a rule that will be applied when an MDC-Web component is within the context of an RTL layout.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   position: absolute;
 *   left: 0;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     left: auto;
 *     right: 0;
 *   }
 *
 *   &__bar {
 *     margin-left: 4px;
 *     @include mdc-rtl(".mdc-foo") {
 *       margin-left: auto;
 *       margin-right: 4px;
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * .mdc-foo--mod {
 *   padding-left: 4px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     padding-left: auto;
 *     padding-right: 4px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that this works by checking for [dir="rtl"] on an ancestor element. While this will work
 * in most cases, it will in some cases lead to false negatives, e.g.
 *
 * ```html
 * <html dir="rtl">
 *   <!-- ... -->
 *   <div dir="ltr">
 *     <div class="mdc-foo">Styled incorrectly as RTL!</div>
 *   </div>
 * </html>
 * ```
 *
 * In the future, selectors such as :dir (http://mdn.io/:dir) will help us mitigate this.
 */
/**
 * Takes a base box-model property - e.g. margin / border / padding - along with a default
 * direction and value, and emits rules which apply the value to the
 * "<base-property>-<default-direction>" property by default, but flips the direction
 * when within an RTL context.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, left, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   margin-left: 8px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 8px;
 *     margin-left: 0;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * whereas:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, right, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   margin-right: 8px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 0;
 *     margin-left: 8px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also pass a 4th optional $root-selector argument which will be forwarded to `mdc-rtl`,
 * e.g. `@include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box-property(margin, left, 8px, ".mdc-component")`.
 *
 * Note that this function will always zero out the original value in an RTL context. If you're
 * trying to flip the values, use mdc-rtl-reflexive-property().
 */
/**
 * Takes a base property and emits rules that assign <base-property>-left to <left-value> and
 * <base-property>-right to <right-value> in a LTR context, and vice versa in a RTL context.
 * For example:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-property(margin, auto, 12px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-left: 12px;

 */
/**
 * Takes an argument specifying a horizontal position property (either "left" or "right") as well
 * as a value, and applies that value to the specified position in a LTR context, and flips it in a

 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-position(left, 0);
 *   position: absolute;
 * }

 *
 *    @include mdc-rtl {

 *    }
 *  }
 * ```
 * An optional third $root-selector argument may also be given, which is passed to `mdc-rtl`.

/**
 * Creates a rule that will be applied when an MDC-Web component is within the context of an RTL layout.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   position: absolute;
 *   left: 0;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     left: auto;
 *     right: 0;
 *   }
 *
 *   &__bar {
 *     margin-left: 4px;
 *     @include mdc-rtl(".mdc-foo") {

 *       margin-right: 4px;

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     padding-left: auto;
 *     padding-right: 4px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that this works by checking for [dir="rtl"] on an ancestor element. While this will work
 * in most cases, it will in some cases lead to false negatives, e.g.
 *
 * ```html
 * <html dir="rtl">
 *   <!-- ... -->
 *   <div dir="ltr">
 *     <div class="mdc-foo">Styled incorrectly as RTL!</div>
 *   </div>
 * </html>
 * ```
 *
 * In the future, selectors such as :dir (http://mdn.io/:dir) will help us mitigate this.

 * direction and value, and emits rules which apply the value to the

 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, left, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 0;
 *     margin-left: 8px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also pass a 4th optional $root-selector argument which will be forwarded to `mdc-rtl`,
 * e.g. `@include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box-property(margin, left, 8px, ".mdc-component")`.
 *
 * Note that this function will always zero out the original value in an RTL context. If you're
 * trying to flip the values, use mdc-rtl-reflexive-property().

/**
 * Creates a rule that will be applied when an MDC-Web component is within the context of an RTL layout.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   position: absolute;
 *   left: 0;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     left: auto;
 *     right: 0;
 *   }
 *
 *   &__bar {
 *     margin-left: 4px;
 *     @include mdc-rtl(".mdc-foo") {
 *       margin-left: auto;
 *       margin-right: 4px;
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * .mdc-foo--mod {
 *   padding-left: 4px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     padding-left: auto;
 *     padding-right: 4px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that this works by checking for [dir="rtl"] on an ancestor element. While this will work
 * in most cases, it will in some cases lead to false negatives, e.g.
 *
 * ```html
 * <html dir="rtl">
 *   <!-- ... -->
 *   <div dir="ltr">
 *     <div class="mdc-foo">Styled incorrectly as RTL!</div>
 *   </div>
 * </html>
 * ```
 *
 * In the future, selectors such as :dir (http://mdn.io/:dir) will help us mitigate this.

/**
 * Takes a base box-model property - e.g. margin / border / padding - along with a default
 * direction and value, and emits rules which apply the value to the
 * "<base-property>-<default-direction>" property by default, but flips the direction
 * when within an RTL context.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, left, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 8px;
 *     margin-left: 0;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * whereas:

 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, right, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   margin-right: 8px;
 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 0;
 *     margin-left: 8px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also pass a 4th optional $root-selector argument which will be forwarded to `mdc-rtl`,
 * e.g. `@include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box-property(margin, left, 8px, ".mdc-component")`.
 *
 * Note that this function will always zero out the original value in an RTL context. If you're
 * trying to flip the values, use mdc-rtl-reflexive-property().

 *   <div dir="ltr">
 *     <div class="mdc-foo">Styled incorrectly as RTL!</div>
 *   </div>

 *
 * In the future, selectors such as :dir (http://mdn.io/:dir) will help us mitigate this.

/**
 * Takes a base box-model property - e.g. margin / border / padding - along with a default
 * direction and value, and emits rules which apply the value to the
 * "<base-property>-<default-direction>" property by default, but flips the direction
 * when within an RTL context.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, left, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 8px;
 *     margin-left: 0;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * whereas:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, right, 8px);
 * }
 * ```

 * ```scss

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 0;
 *     margin-left: 8px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also pass a 4th optional $root-selector argument which will be forwarded to `mdc-rtl`,
 * e.g. `@include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box-property(margin, left, 8px, ".mdc-component")`.
 *
 * Note that this function will always zero out the original value in an RTL context. If you're
 * trying to flip the values, use mdc-rtl-reflexive-property().

/**

 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```scss
 * .mdc-foo {
 *   @include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box(margin, left, 8px);
 * }
 * ```
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 * ```scss

 *
 *   @include mdc-rtl {
 *     margin-right: 0;
 *     margin-left: 8px;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also pass a 4th optional $root-selector argument which will be forwarded to `mdc-rtl`,
 * e.g. `@include mdc-rtl-reflexive-box-property(margin, left, 8px, ".mdc-component")`.
 *

 * trying to flip the values, use mdc-rtl-reflexive-property().

/* ==========  TYPOGRAPHY  ========== */
/* We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
   page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
   immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
   such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
   We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
   definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
   the performance hit.
   We should be able to improve on this once CSS Font Loading L3 becomes more
   widely available.

/* ==========  TYPOGRAPHY  ========== */
/* We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
   page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
   immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
   such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
   We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
   definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
   the performance hit.

/* ==========  TYPOGRAPHY  ========== */
/* We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
   page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
   immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
   such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
   We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
   definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
   the performance hit.
   We should be able to improve on this once CSS Font Loading L3 becomes more
   widely available.

/* We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
   page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
   immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
   such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
   We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
   definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
   the performance hit.
   We should be able to improve on this once CSS Font Loading L3 becomes more

/* ==========  TYPOGRAPHY  ========== */
/* We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
   page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
   immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
   such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
   We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
   definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
   the performance hit.
   We should be able to improve on this once CSS Font Loading L3 becomes more
   widely available.

/* ==========  TYPOGRAPHY  ========== */
/* We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
   page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
   immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
   such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
   We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
   definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
   the performance hit.
   We should be able to improve on this once CSS Font Loading L3 becomes more
   widely available.

/* ==========  TYPOGRAPHY  ========== */
/* We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
   page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
   immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
   such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
   We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
   definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
   the performance hit.
   We should be able to improve on this once CSS Font Loading L3 becomes more
   widely available.

/* ==========  TYPOGRAPHY  ========== */
/* We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
   page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
   immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
   such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
   We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
   definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
   the performance hit.
   We should be able to improve on this once CSS Font Loading L3 becomes more
   widely available.

/* ==========  TYPOGRAPHY  ========== */
/* We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
   page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
   immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
   such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
   We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
   definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
   the performance hit.
   We should be able to improve on this once CSS Font Loading L3 becomes more

/* ==========  TYPOGRAPHY  ========== */
/* We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
   page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
   immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
   such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
   We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
   definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
   the performance hit.

/**
 * IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT CSS ANIMATION PROPERTIES (keanulee):
 *
 * iOS Safari (tested on iOS 8.1) does not handle animation-delay very well - it doesn't
 * guarantee that the animation will start _exactly_ after that value. So we avoid using
 * animation-delay and instead set custom keyframes for each color (as redundant as it
 * seems).
 *
 * We write out each animation in full (instead of separating animation-name,
 * animation-duration, etc.) because under the polyfill, Safari does not recognize those
 * specific properties properly, treats them as -webkit-animation, and overrides the
 * other animation rules. See https://github.com/Polymer/platform/issues/53.

/*******************************

Semantic-UI integration of font-awesome :

///class names are separated
i.icon.circle => i.icon.circle
i.icon.circle-o => i.icon.circle.outline

//abbreviation are replaced by full letters:
i.icon.ellipsis-h => i.icon.ellipsis.horizontal
i.icon.ellipsis-v => i.icon.ellipsis.vertical
.alpha => .i.icon.alphabet
.asc => .i.icon.ascending
.desc => .i.icon.descending
.alt =>.alternate

ASCII order is conserved for easier maintenance.

Icons that only have one style 'outline', 'square' etc do not require this class
for instance `lemon icon` not `lemon outline icon` since there is only one lemon
